# Task: QA After Creation

**Task ID:** qa-after-creation
**Version:** 1.1.0
**Execution Type:** Worker
**Purpose:** Automatic quality assurance check after squad/component creation
**Orchestrator:** @squad-chief
**Mode:** Automatic (triggered by creation tasks)

**Process Specialist:** @pedro-valerio
**Specialist Guidance:**
- Use Process Absolutism principles for validation
- Define VETO conditions that BLOCK, not just warn
- For workflow/process validation, invoke: `@pedro-valerio *audit`
- For designing quality gates, invoke: `@pedro-valerio *design-heuristic`

**Core Philosophy:**
```
Every created component must pass QA before being considered complete.
QA is not optional - it's the final gate before delivery.
Find problems NOW, not when the user tries to use it.
```

## Integration with Creation Tasks

### How to Trigger QA

Add to end of creation tasks:

```yaml
# In create-squad.md, create-agent.md, etc.
post_creation:
  - action: "Run QA"
    task: "qa-after-creation"
    params:
      created_component: "{output_path}"
      component_type: "squad"  # or agent, task, etc.
      creation_task: "{current_task}"
```

### Example Flow

```
User: *create-squad my-new-squad
    ↓
[create-squad executes]
    → Creates squads/my-new-squad/
    → Creates config.yaml, README.md
    → Creates agents/orchestrator.md
    ↓
[qa-after-creation auto-triggers]
    → Quick checks: PASS
    → Security scan: PASS
    → Structure: PASS
    → Quality: 7.8/10
    ↓
Output: "✅ Squad 'my-new-squad' created and validated (Score: 7.8/10)"
```

---

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Auto-triggered (normal flow)
# QA runs automatically after creation

# Manual trigger
@squad-chief
*qa-after-creation squads/my-squad/ --type=squad

# Check specific component
*qa-after-creation squads/my-squad/agents/my-agent.md --type=agent

# With auto-fix attempt
*qa-after-creation squads/my-squad/ --type=squad --auto-fix
```
