# Task: Create Complete Squad

**Task ID:** create-squad
**Version:** 2.0
**Execution Type:** Hybrid
**Purpose:** Create a complete AIOS-FULLSTACK squad through guided elicitation, research, and validation
**Orchestrator:** @squad-chief
**Mode:** Incremental (human checkpoints) or YOLO (autonomous)
**Quality Standard:** AIOS Level (all components meet minimum standards)

**Frameworks Used:**
- `data/tier-system-framework.md` → Agent tier classification (Phase 3)
- `data/quality-dimensions-framework.md` → Squad validation (Phase 6)
- `data/decision-heuristics-framework.md` → Checkpoint logic (Phase 4, 6)
- `data/executor-matrix-framework.md` → Task executor assignment (Phase 4)

---

## Overview

This task creates a complete, production-ready squad with all required components: agents, tasks, workflows, templates, checklists, and knowledge bases. The key insight: **squads must be built on researched elite minds, not generic bots**.

**v2.0 Changes:**
- Mandatory research loop before any agent creation
- PHASE-based structure with checkpoints
- Quality gates with blocking requirements
- Framework integration at every decision point

---

## PHASE 0: DISCOVERY

**Duration:** 5-10 minutes
**Checkpoint:** SC_DSC_001 (Discovery Complete)
**Mode:** Interactive (both modes)

### Step 0.1: Validate Domain Viability

**Actions:**
```yaml
domain_viability_check:
  questions:
    - "Is this domain well-documented with established methodologies?"
    - "Do elite practitioners exist with documented frameworks?"
    - "Can outputs be validated against objective criteria?"
    - "Is there enough depth to warrant a squad (vs single agent)?"

  scoring:
    - documented_methodologies: 0-3
    - elite_practitioners: 0-3
    - validation_criteria: 0-2
    - complexity_warrants_squad: 0-2

  threshold: 6/10
  veto_conditions:
    - elite_practitioners < 2 → "Cannot create quality agents without researched minds"
```

**Decision Point:**
```
IF viability_score >= 6:
    → PROCEED to Step 0.2
ELSE IF viability_score >= 4:
    → WARN: "Domain may not support full squad. Consider single agent."
    → ASK: "Proceed with limited scope?"
ELSE:
    → BLOCK: "Domain lacks sufficient documented frameworks"
    → SUGGEST: "Consider researching domain first or choosing adjacent domain"
```

### Step 0.2: Check Existing Squads

**Actions:**
```yaml
existing_squad_check:
  search_paths:
    - "squads/{similar_names}/"
    - "squads/*/{domain}*"
    - ".claude/commands/*/{domain}*"

  analysis:
    - existing_coverage: "What does existing squad cover?"
    - gap_identification: "What's missing?"
    - extension_vs_new: "Extend existing or create new?"

  output:
    decision: "extend" | "create_new" | "abort_duplicate"
    rationale: "..."
```

**Decision Point:**
```
IF existing squad covers 80%+ of use cases:
    → SUGGEST: "Extend existing squad instead"
    → IF user confirms: → GOTO extend-squad workflow
IF partial overlap:
    → WARN: "Partial overlap detected. Plan for integration."
ELSE:
    → PROCEED to Phase 1
```

### Step 0.3: Define Pack Structure

**Actions:**
```yaml
pack_structure_elicitation:
  required:
    - pack_name: "kebab-case identifier"
    - pack_title: "Human-readable title"
    - version: "1.0.0"
    - author: "Organization or person"
    - slash_prefix: "camelCase for commands"

  derived:
    - pack_path: "squads/{pack_name}/"
    - command_path: ".claude/commands/{PackTitle}/"

  pattern_library:
    - prefix: "2-letter code (e.g., CP for Copy)"
    - initial_patterns:
      - "{PREFIX}-001: Core Process"
      - "{PREFIX}-002: Quality Standard"
      - "{PREFIX}-003: Exception Handling"
```

**Output (PHASE 0):**
```yaml
phase_0_output:
  viability_score: 8/10
  decision: "create_new"
  pack_name: "copy"
  pack_title: "Copy Squad"
  slash_prefix: "copy"
  pattern_prefix: "CP"
  mode: "incremental"
```

## PHASE 1: RESEARCH

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes
**Checkpoint:** SC_RES_001 (Research Quality Gate)
**Mode:** Autonomous (both modes)

### Step 1.1: Execute Mind Research Loop

**CRITICAL:** This step is MANDATORY. No agent creation without research.

**Actions:**
```yaml
execute_workflow:
  workflow: "workflows/mind-research-loop.md"
  inputs:
    domain: "{domain}"
    min_minds: 5
    max_minds: 10
    iterations: 3-5

  execution_mode: "autonomous"
  human_review: false  # Research loop handles validation internally
```

**Mind Research Loop Summary:**
```
Iteration 1: Broad research (find 15-20 names)
Iteration 2: Devil's advocate (cut weak candidates)
Iteration 3: Framework validation (SC_FV_001)
Output: Curated list of elite minds with documented frameworks
```

### Step 1.2: Validate Research Output

**Actions:**
```yaml
research_validation:
  # From data/quality-dimensions-framework.md
  dimensions_to_check:
    - accuracy: "Are the minds real with verifiable work?"
    - coherence: "Do the frameworks complement each other?"
    - strategic_alignment: "Do they cover the use cases?"
    - operational_excellence: "Is the research actionable?"

  # From data/decision-heuristics-framework.md
  apply_heuristic:
    id: SC_RES_001
    name: "Research Quality Gate"
    threshold: 7.0
    blocking: true

    criteria:
      - minds_count >= 5
      - all_minds_have_frameworks: true
      - tier_0_covered: true
      - use_cases_mapped >= 80%

    veto_conditions:
      - minds_count < 3 → "Insufficient research"
      - no_tier_0_minds → "No diagnostic/foundation agent"
```

**Output (PHASE 1):**
```yaml
phase_1_output:
  minds:
    - name: "Gary Halbert"
      tier: 1
      frameworks: ["A-Pile/B-Pile", "Swipe File Method"]
      covers_use_cases: ["sales pages", "direct mail"]

    - name: "Eugene Schwartz"
      tier: 0
      frameworks: ["Market Awareness", "5 Levels of Sophistication"]
      covers_use_cases: ["all - diagnostic"]

    # ... more minds

  research_score: 8.5/10
  checkpoint_status: "PASS"
```

## PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE

**Duration:** 10-20 minutes
**Checkpoint:** SC_ARC_001 (Architecture Approved)
**Mode:** Interactive (incremental) / Autonomous (YOLO)

### Step 2.1: Define Tier Structure

**Apply: tier-system-framework.md**

**Actions:**
```yaml
tier_structure_design:
  # Assign each mind to a tier
  orchestrator:
    purpose: "Coordinates all tiers, routes requests"
    candidates: "New agent or promote from Tier 0"

  tier_0_diagnosis:
    purpose: "First contact, analysis, classification"
    minds: "Those who created diagnostic frameworks"
    required: true  # Every squad MUST have Tier 0

  tier_1_masters:
    purpose: "Primary experts with proven results"
    minds: "Those with documented $X results"

  tier_2_systematizers:
    purpose: "Created frameworks others use"
    minds: "Thought leaders, framework creators"

  tier_3_specialists:
    purpose: "Specific format/channel experts"

      to: "tier_0_agents"
      when: "New request arrives"

    - from: "tier_0_agents"
      to: "tier_1_agents"
      when: "Diagnosis complete, execution needed"

  synergies:
    # Who works well together
    - agents: ["diagnosis-agent", "master-agent"]
      pattern: "Diagnosis feeds master context"

  conflicts:
    # Who should NOT be combined
    - agents: ["aggressive-style", "conservative-style"]
      reason: "Contradictory approaches"
```

### Step 2.3: Design Quality Gates

**Actions:**
```yaml
quality_gates_design:
  gates:
    - id: "QG-001"
      name: "Request Classification"
      transition: "Input → Tier 0"
      type: "routing"
      criteria: "Request type identified"

    - id: "QG-002"
      name: "Diagnosis Complete"
      transition: "Tier 0 → Tier 1"
      type: "blocking"
      criteria: "Analysis approved, requirements clear"

    - id: "QG-003"
      name: "Draft Review"
      transition: "Execution → Output"
      type: "blocking"
      criteria: "Quality checklist passed"

  escalation_paths:
    - on_failure: "Return to previous tier with feedback"
    - on_repeated_failure: "Escalate to human review"
```

**Output (PHASE 2):**
```yaml
phase_2_output:  # [Example]
  tier_structure:
    orchestrator: "{squad}-chief"
    tier_0: ["{diagnosis-agent-1}", "{diagnosis-agent-2}"]
    tier_1: ["{master-agent-1}", "{master-agent-2}"]
    tier_2: ["{systematizer-1}", "{systematizer-2}"]
    tier_3: ["{specialist-1}", "{specialist-2}"]
    tools: ["{tool-1}", "{tool-2}"]

      - ELSE IF needs_judgment → Hybrid (AI draft, human approve)
      - ELSE IF creative_synthesis → Agent
      - ELSE → Human

  quality_standard:
    simple_tasks: 300+ lines
