## Part 2: Task Anatomy Compliance (HO-TP-001)

### 2.1 Required Fields per Step

For EACH process step, verify:

| Step | task_name | status | executor | exec_type | est_time | inputs | outputs | actions | criteria |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|----------|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| 1 | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 2 | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 3 | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| ... | | | | | | | | | |

**Score:** ___% steps with 8/8 fields | **Threshold:** 100%

---

## Part 3: Executor Classification (HO-EP Framework)

### 3.1 Every Step Has Executor Type

- [ ] All steps have executor_type assigned
- [ ] Executor types are valid: Human | Agent | Hybrid | Worker

### 3.2 Classification Justification

- [ ] Human steps have cognitive justification (empathy, negotiation, accountability, ethics)
- [ ] Agent steps have automation justification (perception, analysis, synthesis)
- [ ] Hybrid steps have checkpoint defined
- [ ] Worker steps are 100% deterministic

**Score:** ___% steps with justified executor | **Threshold:** 100%

---

## Part 4: Cognitive Analysis

### 4.1 Cognitive Type per Step

- [ ] Each step has cognitive type(s) identified
- [ ] Evidence from transcript cited for classification

### 4.2 Automation Potential

- [ ] Each step evaluated for automation potential
- [ ] Non-automatable steps have "what requires human" documented
- [ ] Partially automatable steps have "what agent can do" documented

**Score:** ___% steps with cognitive analysis | **Threshold:** 100%

---

## Part 5: Decision Rules

### 5.1 Decision Points Captured

- [ ] All "if/when/depends" statements converted to decision points
- [ ] Each decision point has: question, options, criteria, decider

### 5.2 IF/THEN Rules

- [ ] Heuristics translated to explicit IF/THEN rules
- [ ] Rules marked as automatable or human-required

**Score:** ___/___  decision points documented | **Threshold:** 100%

---

## Part 6: Automation Analysis (PV_PM_001)

### 6.1 Frequency/Impact/Automatability Matrix

- [ ] Each step evaluated on: Frequency, Impact, Automatability
- [ ] Decision assigned: AUTOMATE | DELEGATE | KEEP_MANUAL | ELIMINATE

### 6.2 Guardrails Requirement

- [ ] VETO applied to any automation without guardrails
- [ ] Guardrails defined for each automated step:
  - [ ] Loop Prevention
  - [ ] Idempotency
  - [ ] Audit Trail
  - [ ] Escape Route
  - [ ] Retry Logic (if external integration)
  - [ ] Rollback (if destructive)

**Score:** ___% automatable steps with guardrails | **Threshold:** 100%

---

## Part 7: META-AXIOMAS Score

### 7.1 10 Dimensions Evaluated

| # | Dimension | Score (0-10) | Above 6.0? |
|---|-----------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Truthfulness | | ☐ |
| 2 | Coherence | | ☐ |
| 3 | Strategic Alignment | | ☐ |
| 4 | Operational Excellence | | ☐ |
| 5 | Innovation Capacity | | ☐ |
| 6 | Risk Management | | ☐ |
| 7 | Resource Optimization | | ☐ |
| 8 | Stakeholder Value | | ☐ |
| 9 | Sustainability | | ☐ |
| 10 | Adaptability | | ☐ |

**Overall Score:** ___/10 | **Threshold:** ≥7.0
