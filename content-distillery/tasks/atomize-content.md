# Task: Atomize Content

**Task ID:** content-distillery/atomize-content
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Production Ready
**Created:** 2026-02-12
**Category:** Content Derivation Workflow
**Total Lines:** 450+

---

## Executive Summary

This is an atomic task that breaks pillar content (distilled frameworks, long-form summaries, full articles) into 30-64+ atomic content pieces optimized for multi-platform distribution. Each piece is a standalone unit of value adapted to a specific platform's format, tone, and algorithm requirements. This is the core "1 to many" content multiplication engine.

**Workflow Position:** Post-distillation, pre-production (transforms raw material into distribution-ready atoms)
**Success Definition:** 30+ standalone content pieces from a single pillar, each platform-adapted
**Output Quality Gate:** Every piece passes the Standalone Value Test (makes sense without prior context)

---

## Purpose

Maximize the ROI of every hour of livestream content by extracting every possible derivative piece. A single 2-hour live contains enough material for 4-8 weeks of multi-platform content. Without systematic atomization, creators publish 1-3 pieces from a live that could yield 60+. This task implements Gary Vaynerchuk's Reverse Pyramid model to ensure zero waste from source material.

This task turns 1 hour of content investment into 30-64+ distribution touchpoints, multiplying reach by 30-64x per source.

## Executor Type

**Agent (content-atomizer)**

- **Agent Role:** Full content decomposition, platform adaptation, tagging, quality checking
- **Human Role:** Final review of voice/tone accuracy on 10-20% of pieces; approval of controversial takes
- **Autonomy Level:** 85% Agent / 15% Human (human reviews tone, agent handles structure)

distilled_content:
  field: "Layer 4-5 progressive summarization output"
  format: "Markdown files with highlighted key insights"
  required: true
  example: |
    ## Layer 4: Core Content Leverage Principles

    **[HIGHLIGHT]** The single biggest mistake creators make is treating each
    platform as separate. The content is the SAME — only the packaging changes.

    Three frameworks dominate content leverage:
    1. Barbell Strategy: Only ultra-short or ultra-long
    2. Content Flywheel: Each piece feeds the next
    3. Audience Bridge: Use one platform to pull to another

    **[HIGHLIGHT]** "You don't need more ideas. You need more angles on
    the same idea." — Alex Hormozi
  validation: "Must include Layer 4+ with highlighted passages and at least 5 key insights"

framework_catalog:
  field: "Extracted frameworks from identify-frameworks task"
  format: "YAML with framework definitions"

        name: "Barbell Content Strategy"
        key_insight: "Only ultra-short or ultra-long"
        quotable: "The middle is where content goes to die"
  validation: "Must include framework names, key insights, and quotable lines"

---

## Preconditions

Before starting this task:

- [ ] Progressive summarization complete (Layer 4-5 outputs exist)
- [ ] Framework extraction complete (identify-frameworks output exists)
- [ ] Source metadata available (speaker, date, platform)
- [ ] Target platforms defined (at least 2)
- [ ] Brand voice guidelines available (or default to source speaker)

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Load and Inventory Source Material (5 min)

**Agent Activity:**
- Load all Layer 4-5 distilled content
- Load framework catalog
- Count total atomizable elements: key insights, frameworks, quotable lines, examples, stories, data points, contrarian takes
- Create inventory:
  ```yaml
  inventory:
    key_insights: 12
    frameworks: 5
    quotable_lines: 8
    examples_stories: 6
    data_points: 4
    contrarian_takes: 3
    total_atomizable_elements: 38
  ```
- Estimate yield: "38 elements x 1.7 avg pieces/element = ~64 content pieces"

**Error Handling:**
- If distilled content has < 5 key insights: warn "Low yield expected (<15 pieces)"
- If no quotable lines found: generate from key insights (paraphrase into punchy format)
- If framework catalog is empty: proceed with insights and heuristics only

**Checkpoint:** Inventory complete with element count and yield estimate

---

### Step 2: Apply Reverse Pyramid Decomposition (15 min)

**Agent Activity:**
- Decompose content through 4 levels of the Reverse Pyramid:

  **Level 1 — Pillar (Full-length, 1-2 pieces)**
  - Complete article/newsletter from distilled content
  - 1,500-3,000 words covering all frameworks
  - Serves as "source of truth" for all derivative pieces

  **Level 2 — Mid-Form Sections (3-5 pieces)**
  - Break pillar into major themes or sections
  - Each is 400-800 words, can stand alone
  - Typically maps 1 framework per section
  - Example: "The Barbell Strategy Explained" (standalone deep dive)

  **Level 3 — Short-Form Insights (15-25 pieces)**
  - Individual insights as standalone posts
  - Each is 100-300 words (or 60-second script)
  - One core idea per piece, self-contained
  - Formats: opinion post, lesson learned, story, how-to, myth-bust
  - Example: "Stop making 10-minute videos. Here's why."

  **Level 4 — Micro Content (15-30 pieces)**
  - Quote graphics (1 sentence + attribution)
  - One-liner hooks (curiosity gap openers)
  - Data point callouts (single stat + context)
  - Contrarian statements (provoke engagement)
  - Question prompts (audience engagement drivers)
  - Example: "The middle is where content goes to die." — Alex Hormozi

- Tag each piece with pyramid level and source element ID

**Error Handling:**
- If a section doesn't decompose cleanly into Level 3: keep as mid-form, don't force it
- If Level 4 yield is low: create variations of strongest Level 3 pieces
- If total < 30 pieces: revisit Level 3 to extract more angles per insight

**Checkpoint:** All 4 levels populated; total piece count >= 30

---

### Step 3: Adapt Each Piece for Target Platforms (20 min)

**Agent Activity:**
- For each piece at each pyramid level, create platform-specific versions:

  **LinkedIn Adaptation:**
  - Hook: Strong opening line (pattern interrupt or contrarian take)
  - Body: 3-5 short paragraphs, storytelling or framework-driven
  - CTA: Question or invitation to comment
  - Constraints: 3,000 char max, ideal 1,300 chars, minimal emojis, 3-5 hashtags
  - Tone: Expert sharing insight with peers

  **Twitter/X Adaptation — Thread:**
  - Hook tweet: Curiosity gap or bold claim (< 280 chars)
  - Body: 3-8 tweets, one idea per tweet
  - CTA tweet: Retweet prompt or question
  - Tone: Sharp, opinionated, conversational

  **Twitter/X Adaptation — Standalone:**
  - Single tweet, < 280 chars, punchy with zero filler words
  - Tone: Sharp, memorable

  **Instagram Adaptation — Carousel:**
  - 7-10 slides
  - Slide 1: Hook (bold statement or question)
  - Slides 2-N: One point per slide, < 40 words per slide
  - Last slide: CTA (save, share, follow)
  - Caption: 400-800 words storytelling with line breaks

  **Instagram Adaptation — Story:**
  - 3-5 screens, casual, question-based
  - Low production feel, authentic engagement

  **YouTube Shorts Adaptation:**
  - 30-60 seconds
  - Hook: First 3 seconds (pattern interrupt)
  - Content: One insight clearly explained
  - Payoff: Surprising conclusion or actionable takeaway
  - Script format: `[HOOK - 3s] [CONTENT - 20-40s] [PAYOFF - 5-10s]`

  **Newsletter Snippet Adaptation:**
  - 150-300 words
  - Teaser: Intriguing opening that creates curiosity
  - Insight: Core framework or lesson
  - CTA: Link to full content or reply prompt

- Ensure attribution to original source in every piece
- Apply brand voice guidelines where provided

**Error Handling:**
- If piece doesn't work for a platform: skip that platform version, log reason
- If tone adaptation feels forced: keep closer to original, flag for human review
- If piece exceeds platform constraints: trim from bottom up (weakest sentence first)

**Checkpoint:** Every piece has at least 2 platform versions; all within platform constraints

---

### Step 4: Tag and Categorize All Pieces (5 min)

**Agent Activity:**
- Tag each piece with structured metadata:
  ```yaml
  piece_tags:
    id: "piece_001"
    source_framework: "fw_001"
    source_element: "key_insight_03"
    pyramid_level: 3
    platform: "linkedin"
    format: "opinion_post"
    urgency: "evergreen"
    engagement_type: "thought_leadership"
    estimated_engagement: "high"
    content_pillar: "content_strategy"
    hashtags: ["#ContentStrategy", "#CreatorEconomy"]
  ```

- Create distribution matrix:
  ```
  | Platform      | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Total |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
  | LinkedIn      | 1       | 3       | 8       | 5       | 17    |
  | Twitter/X     | 0       | 2       | 10      | 12      | 24    |
  | Instagram     | 0       | 2       | 6       | 8       | 16    |
  | YouTube Shorts| 0       | 0       | 5       | 0       | 5     |
  | Newsletter    | 1       | 3       | 4       | 2       | 10    |
  | **Total**     | **2**   | **10**  | **33**  | **27**  | **72**|
  ```

**Error Handling:**
- If any platform has < 5 pieces: flag as "under-represented" in report
- If any pyramid level has 0 pieces for main platforms: revisit Step 2 for that level

**Checkpoint:** All pieces tagged; distribution matrix complete

---

### Step 5: Quality Check — Standalone Value Test (10 min)

**Agent Activity:**
- For EACH piece, apply the Standalone Value Test (SVT):

  **SVT Criteria (all must pass):**
  1. **Context-free comprehension:** Would someone with zero prior context understand this?
  2. **Single clear takeaway:** Can the reader articulate the ONE thing they learned?
  3. **Platform-native feel:** Does it feel like it was CREATED for this platform, not repurposed?
  4. **Attribution present:** Is the source/speaker credited (where appropriate)?
  5. **CTA exists:** Is there a clear next action for the reader?

  **Scoring:**
  - 5/5: Ready to publish
  - 4/5: Minor edit needed (flag specific fix)
  - 3/5: Rewrite required (send back to Step 3)
  - < 3/5: Discard piece (not worth salvaging)

- Discard any piece scoring < 3/5
- Flag pieces scoring 4/5 with specific edit notes
- Track overall quality distribution

**Error Handling:**
- If > 20% of pieces score < 3/5: re-evaluate source material quality
- If a specific platform consistently scores low: review platform adaptation rules
- If SVT reveals context dependency: add 1-sentence context opener to piece

**Checkpoint:** All pieces scored; low-quality pieces discarded or rewritten; final count confirmed

---

### Step 6: Organize and Save Output (5 min)

**Agent Activity:**
- Create output directory structure:
  ```
  {slug}/content-pieces/
  ├── pillar/
  │   └── full-article.md
  ├── linkedin/
  │   ├── piece-001-opinion-barbell-strategy.md
  │   ├── piece-002-story-content-flywheel.md
  │   └── ...
  ├── twitter-x/
  │   ├── piece-001-thread-leverage-frameworks.md
  │   ├── piece-002-standalone-hook-test.md
  │   └── ...
  ├── instagram/
  │   ├── piece-001-carousel-content-types.md
  │   └── ...
  ├── youtube-shorts/

  ├── newsletter/
  │   ├── piece-001-teaser-leverage-principles.md
  │   └── ...
  ├── manifest.yaml
  └── quality-report.yaml
  ```

- Generate manifest:
  ```yaml
  atomization:
    source: "Alex Hormozi - Content Leverage Live"
    date_atomized: "2026-02-12"
    total_pieces: 64
    pieces_by_platform:
      linkedin: 17
      twitter_x: 24
      instagram: 16
      youtube_shorts: 5
      newsletter: 10
    pieces_by_level:
      pillar: 2
      mid_form: 10
      short_form: 33
      micro: 27
    quality_distribution:
      ready_5_of_5: 48
      needs_edit_4_of_5: 12
      rewritten_3_of_5: 4
      discarded: 3
    estimated_content_days: 32
  ```

**Error Handling:**
- If file write fails: retry, then save to alternate location
- If manifest generation fails: save pieces without manifest, log error

**Checkpoint:** All files saved; manifest generated; quality report complete

---

## Estimated Effort

| Role | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Agent (content-atomizer)** | 45-60 min | Decomposition, adaptation, quality check |
| **Human** | 10-15 min | Review tone/voice accuracy, approve controversial takes |
| **Total Duration** | 55-75 min | Mostly autonomous with tone review checkpoint |

---

## Integration

### Feeds To

**Downstream Tasks:**
- `design-ecosystem` — Uses content pieces to plan distribution sequence
- `produce-batch` — Uses content pieces as production input
- `optimize-youtube` — Uses YouTube-tagged pieces for optimization

### Depends On

- `progressive-summarize` — Provides Layer 4-5 distilled content
- `identify-frameworks` — Provides framework catalog with quotable lines
- Source metadata: Speaker, date, platform information

### Agent Routing

**Primary Agent:** content-atomizer (Gary Vaynerchuk methodology)
**Supporting Agents:** idea-multiplier (generates angle variations for Level 3-4)

**Handoff:** Content pieces ready for ecosystem design and batch production

---

## Quality Threshold

**Pass/Fail Gate:** Total pieces >= 30 AND SVT pass rate >= 70%

If failing:
1. If yield < 30: Re-examine source material; may need richer input from extraction
2. If SVT < 70%: Review platform adaptation rules; pieces may need more context
3. Re-run Steps 2-5 with adjusted parameters
4. If still failing: source material may be too thin; flag for additional extraction

**Common Failure Reasons:**
- Source material too thin (< 5 key insights produces < 20 pieces)
- Platform adaptation is copy-paste (no real format change)
- Missing CTAs on most pieces
- Pieces are context-dependent (fail SVT on comprehension)
- Overproduction of Level 4 micro with no Level 2-3 substance

---

## Error Handling

### Input Errors

| Error | Detection | Recovery |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| No distilled content | Empty input path | HALT, report "progressive-summarize task not completed" |
| No framework catalog | Missing file | Proceed with insights only, warn "reduced yield expected" |
| No quotable lines | Catalog has no `quotable` field | Generate from key insights via paraphrase |
| Missing source metadata | No speaker/date info | Use "Unknown Source" with flag for human to fill |

### Processing Errors

| Error | Detection | Recovery |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Piece exceeds char limit | Platform validation | Trim weakest sentences, re-validate |
| All hooks same pattern | Pattern detection | Force 3 different hook types across batch |
| SVT mass failure (>30%) | Quality check stats | Review source quality, may need re-extraction |
| Platform has 0 pieces | Distribution matrix gap | Create at least 3 pieces for that platform or exclude |

## Notes for Executor

### If Source Has Strong Quotable Lines

- Prioritize Level 4 quote graphics (high engagement, low effort)
- Create "quote + 2-sentence context" format for LinkedIn
- Use quotes as Twitter standalone tweets
- Generate 2-3 variations per quote (same idea, different framing)

### If Source Is Framework-Heavy (5+ frameworks)

- Each framework gets its own Level 2 mid-form piece
- Create "Framework vs Framework" comparison pieces (high engagement)
- Design a "framework collection" carousel for Instagram
- Consider a "framework cheat sheet" as bonus Level 1 pillar

### If Source Is Story-Heavy

- Extract story arcs for LinkedIn storytelling posts
- Create "before/after" micro pieces
- Use story moments as YouTube Shorts hooks
- Thread narrative across multiple Twitter posts

### If Low Yield Warning Triggers

- Go deeper into each insight (more angles, not more insights)
- Create "what if" and "myth vs reality" variations
- Add audience question prompts (engagement pieces count toward yield)
- Combine 2 related insights into comparison pieces

---

## Example: Single Insight Atomized Across Platforms

**Source Insight:** "The middle is where content goes to die" (Barbell Strategy)

**LinkedIn (Level 3):**
```
Stop making 10-minute videos.

I know. You spent hours scripting, filming, editing.
But the data is brutal: medium-length content has the worst
effort-to-reach ratio of any format.

Alex Hormozi calls this the "Barbell Strategy":
- Go ultra-short (< 60 seconds) for reach
- Go ultra-long (> 60 minutes) for depth
- Skip everything in between

The middle is where content goes to die.

What's your experience — shorter or longer pieces perform better?

#ContentStrategy #CreatorEconomy #ContentMarketing
```

**Twitter/X (Level 4):**
```
The Barbell Content Strategy:

Only make content that's < 60 seconds or > 60 minutes.

The middle is where content goes to die.

(h/t @AlexHormozi)
```

**Instagram Carousel (Level 4):**
```
Slide 1: "Stop making 10-minute videos"
Slide 2: "The Barbell Content Strategy"
Slide 3: "Ultra-short (< 60s) = REACH"
Slide 4: "Ultra-long (> 60min) = DEPTH"
Slide 5: "The middle = GRAVEYARD"
Slide 6: "Save this for your next content plan"
```

**YouTube Short Script (Level 3):**
```
[HOOK - 3s] "Stop making 10-minute videos. Seriously."
[CONTENT - 25s] "There's something called the Barbell Strategy.
You only make content in two formats: ultra-short, under 60 seconds,
or ultra-long, over 60 minutes. Everything in between? That's where
content goes to die. Short gets you reach. Long gets you trust.
The middle gets you nothing."
[PAYOFF - 5s] "Pick a side. Your audience will thank you."
```
