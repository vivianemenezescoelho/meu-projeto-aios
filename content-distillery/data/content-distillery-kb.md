# Content Distillery Knowledge Base

## Domain Overview

Content Distillery operates at the intersection of knowledge management, content strategy, and framework extraction. Its purpose is to transform long-form YouTube livestreams (typically 1-4 hours) into structured intellectual property: frameworks, heuristics, mental models, and multi-platform content pieces.

The domain draws from three disciplines:
1. **Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM)** — How experts actually think and decide under pressure
2. **Knowledge Management** — How to capture, organize, and retrieve knowledge effectively
3. **Content Repurposing** — How to extract maximum value from a single content source

## Key Concepts

### Tacit Knowledge
Knowledge that experts use but cannot easily articulate. Three types (per Cedric Chin):
- **Relational:** Pattern recognition from experience ("I've seen this before")
- **Somatic:** Body-based knowledge ("it feels right")
- **Collective:** Shared understanding within a group ("everyone here knows...")

### Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) Model
How experts make decisions: they don't weigh options — they recognize patterns from prior experience and simulate the first plausible option mentally. Extraction involves identifying these recognition patterns.

### Framework
A structured model for thinking about a problem. Components:
- **Name** — Memorable label
- **Components** — Building blocks (3-7 elements)
- **Application Rules** — When to use, when not to use
- **Heuristics** — Practical "if X then Y" rules derived from the framework

### Heuristic
A practical decision rule: "If [trigger condition], then [action], because [reasoning]." More actionable than frameworks, more specific than principles.

### Mental Model
A representation of how something works. From Shane Parrish's library of 100+ models across physics, biology, economics, psychology, etc. Used to identify patterns across domains.

### Progressive Summarization (Tiago Forte)
5-layer compression:
- **Layer 1:** Full transcript (100%)
- **Layer 2:** Bold key passages (20-30% of L1)
- **Layer 3:** Highlight critical insights (10-15% of L1)
- **Layer 4:** Executive summary (500-1000 words)
- **Layer 5:** Personal remix (200-400 words in your own voice)

### PARA Method (Tiago Forte)
Organization system:
- **Projects:** Active efforts with deadlines
- **Areas:** Ongoing responsibilities
- **Resources:** Topics of interest
- **Archives:** Completed/inactive items

### C.O.D.E. Framework (Tiago Forte)
Knowledge workflow:
- **Capture** — Save interesting information
- **Organize** — Sort into PARA categories
- **Distill** — Progressive summarization
- **Express** — Create new content from organized knowledge

### 4A Framework (Nicolas Cole & Dickie Bush)
Four angles for any content piece:
- **Actionable:** "Here's how" (step-by-step)
- **Analytical:** "Here's a breakdown" (data/evidence)
- **Aspirational:** "Here's what's possible" (vision/transformation)
- **Anthropological:** "Here's why" (human behavior/psychology)

### Reverse Pyramid Model (Gary Vaynerchuk)
Content atomization hierarchy:
- **Pillar Content:** Long-form source (the livestream)
- **Macro Content:** Blog posts, long articles (2000+ words)
- **Micro Content:** Social posts, threads, carousels (100-500 words)
- **Nano Content:** Quotes, one-liners, thumbnails

### 64-Piece Rule (Gary Vaynerchuk)
One pillar content piece should generate 64+ derivative pieces across platforms. This is the North Star metric for content atomization efficiency.

### Content Map (Dan Koe)
Four categories for content ecosystem:
- **Roads:** How-to content (builds trust through utility)
- **Obstacles:** Warning content (builds trust through protection)
- **Attractions:** Teaching content (builds authority through depth)
- **Legends:** Skill content (builds expertise through demonstration)
- **Landscapes:** Mindset content (builds connection through shared values)

### 2-Hour Content Ecosystem (Dan Koe)
Complete weekly content system in 2 hours:
- 1 pillar piece → 5-7 micro pieces → scheduled across platforms
- Focus on consistency over perfection

### Content OS (Justin Welsh)
Production system:
- **730-Day Library:** Evergreen content that can be recycled every 2 years
- **Sub-topic x Style Matrix:** Cross-reference expertise areas with content formats
- **Batch Production:** Write multiple pieces in one session, schedule across days
- **Content Recycling:** Best-performing content gets refreshed and reposted

### CCN Rule (Paddy Galloway)
YouTube video must serve three audiences simultaneously:
- **Core viewers:** Already subscribe, want depth and nuance
- **Casual viewers:** Know you, watch occasionally, need hooks
- **New viewers:** Never seen you, need context and accessibility

### Clickbait Theory (Paddy Galloway)
Ethical engagement optimization:
- Title creates curiosity gap (promise of value)
- Thumbnail triggers emotional response (curiosity, surprise, fear)
- Content delivers on the promise (never bait-and-switch)
- Opening 30 seconds validates the click

### Format-First Thinking (Paddy Galloway)
Design the content format BEFORE writing the content:
- "What type of video is this?" before "What do I say?"
- Formats: listicle, case study, comparison, tutorial, story, reaction
- Each format has proven retention curves and viewer expectations

## Best Practices

### From Cedric Chin (Tacit Knowledge Extraction)
1. Look for decisions, not just statements
2. Ask "what would a novice miss here?"
3. Extract the recognition patterns, not just the rules
4. Always include direct quotes with timestamps as evidence
5. Classify knowledge type (relational/somatic/collective) for better retrieval

### From Shane Parrish (Mental Model Identification)
1. Map to known models first before declaring novelty
2. Cross-reference across domains (physics → business, biology → strategy)
3. Build lattices, not lists — models connect to each other
4. Test each model with "does this help predict outcomes?"
5. Maintain a personal model library for faster matching

### From Tiago Forte (Knowledge Architecture)
1. Capture first, organize later (don't filter on input)
2. Organize for action, not just storage
3. Progressive summarization forces you to understand before you share
4. Intermediate packets are the atoms of knowledge work
5. PARA keeps everything connected to current projects

### From Gary Vaynerchuk (Content Atomization)
1. Document, don't create — your process IS the content
2. Pillar content should be authentic and unscripted
3. Each platform has its own native format — respect it
4. Volume beats perfection in the early stages
5. Repurpose ruthlessly — your audience is not the same on every platform

### From Nicolas Cole & Dickie Bush (Idea Multiplication)
1. Every topic has 4 angles — use all of them
2. The 2-Year Test: will this topic still matter in 2 years?
3. Write for a specific person (FOR WHO / SO THAT)
4. Endless Idea Generator: 10 Topics × 4 Angles × 7 Formats = 280 ideas
5. The best content is specific, not broad

### From Dan Koe (Content Ecosystem)
1. Your content map should have all 5 types represented
2. One Vision + One Anti-Vision = complete messaging
3. Content ecosystem should be self-sustaining (each piece feeds the next)
4. Personal brand IS the business — content is the product
5. Newsletter is the only platform you own — prioritize it

### From Justin Welsh (Content Production)
1. Batch production beats daily creation
2. Your best content should be recycled every 2 years
3. The Sub-topic × Style matrix prevents creative block
4. Track what performs and double down
5. Systems beat motivation — build the machine

### From Paddy Galloway (YouTube Strategy)
1. The thumbnail is 50% of the video's success
2. Title + thumbnail must work together (not redundant)
3. First 30 seconds determine retention — hook hard
4. CCN Rule ensures you don't lose any audience segment
5. Study what works (outperformers), not what doesn't

## Anti-Patterns

### AP-001: Transcription Without Extraction
Generating a transcript and jumping directly to content creation without extracting frameworks and heuristics. Results in shallow, surface-level content.

### AP-002: Framework Overload
Extracting 20+ frameworks from a single source without prioritizing. Cognitive overload prevents action. Stick to top 5-7 highest-confidence frameworks.

### AP-003: Platform-Agnostic Content
Writing one piece and copy-pasting across platforms. Each platform has native formats — respect them.

### AP-004: Skipping Progressive Summarization
Jumping from raw transcript to content. Without the compression layers, you miss the deeper insights and produce content that's just "summarized notes."

### AP-005: Hook Neglect
Writing great content with weak hooks. The hook is 80% of performance. Invest disproportionate effort in the first line.

### AP-006: No Cross-Referencing
Processing each livestream in isolation. The real value comes from connecting frameworks across sources — finding reinforcements, contradictions, and meta-patterns.

## Regulatory / Ethical Considerations

1. **Attribution:** Always credit the original speaker and source
2. **Fair Use:** Extracting frameworks and ideas is transformative use; direct quotes should be brief and attributed
3. **No Misrepresentation:** Don't present derivative content as original insights without citing the source
4. **Accuracy:** Verify framework components against source material — don't inject meaning that wasn't there
5. **Platform Terms:** Respect each platform's terms of service for content length, format, and engagement practices
